It solves the problem that you often have to paste some text you've just recently copied to the clipboard, but that has been replaced by something you've copied more recently... It also saves the history so it'll appear just as you left it on the last shutdown.\r\n\r\nIf you want to paste some text that isn't in the clipboard any more, simply hit _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ to summon the Clipdinger window. Here you can select an entry with the _CursorUp/Down_ keys and put it into the clipboard or auto-paste it by hitting _RETURN_.\r\n\r\nAfter selecting a clip, you can also paste it to the online service [Sprunge.us](http://sprunge.us) by hitting _ALT_ + _P_. The returned URL for the clip is put into the clipboard for you to paste into your email or IRC channel etc.\r\n\r\n_ESCAPE_  or _ALT_ + _W_ aborts and minimizes the Clipdinger window.\r\n\r\n### History & Favorites\r\n\r\nClipdinger starts minimized, because it sits in the background and just monitors the system clipboard. When activated by pressing _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ its main window pops up:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger.png)\r\n\r\nTo the left is a history of your past clippings (empty, of course, when started for the first time). For easier orientation, the icon of the app that a clip was copied from is drawn to the left of the text. The top entry is always what's currently in the clipboard. Hover your mouse pointer over an entry for a tool tip with the time and date when a clip was added.\r\n\r\nIf you have the _Fade history entries over time_ option activated, there'll also be a checkbox _Pause fading_ below the history list. You find more on that farther down, where Clipdinger's settings are discussed.\r\n\r\nTo the right is a list of saved favorites. You right-click on an entry in the history to the left, and choose Add to favorites to make a clipping a favorite. The first 12 entries have automatically an _F-key_ assigned for even quicker pasting of your most used clippings.\r\n\r\nYou can adjust the size of history/favorites by grabbing the dotted line between them. You can also completely collapse one of those lists. The _F-keys_ will still work, even if your favorites are collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe _Move up_ and _Move down_ buttons allow for re-ordering the currently selected favorite.\r\n_DEL_ or choosing _Remove favorite_ from the context menu eliminates an entry. _Edit title_ let's you choose another title for it. By default, the contents of the clip is displayed, just like for the history list on the left.\r\n\r\nYou can quickly switch between history and favorites lists with _CursorRight/Left_.\r\n\r\n### Clipboard monitor\r\n\r\nYou can open the _Clipboard monitor_ from the _App_ menu. It simply shows the current contents of theclipboard, which helps if you have to continuously switch between some clips from the history/favorites.\r\nThe Clipboard monitor is supposed be used as a replicant on the Desktop.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipboard-monitor.png)\r\n\r\nAdjust the window size until it fits your needs, then drag the little handle onto the Desktop. Make sure the option to _Show replicants_ in the Deskbar is active.\r\n\r\nYou can change the background by dropping a color onto it from any application, like e.g. Icon-O-Matic. Like the icon labels on the Desktop, the color of the text will toggle automatically between black and white according to the brightness of the dropped background color.\r\n\r\nAs a replicant the Clipboard monitor doesn't need a running Clipdinger to work. Double-clicking on the replicant will, however, summon Clipdinger by either launching it or simply unhiding its main window.\r\n\r\n### Settings\r\n\r\nThis is the settings window, summoned with _Settings..._ from the _App_ menu:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humdingerb/clipdinger/master/images/clipdinger-settings.png)\r\n\r\nAt the top of the settings window, you can set the number of entries in the history (the default is 100).\r\nKeep in mind that every clipping is kept in memory and if you copy many large blocks of text, you may clog up your memory. Though, for everyday use, where clippings are seldom larger than a few KiBs at most, having several dozen entries in the history shouldn't tax memory noticeably.\r\n\r\nOnce the limit of the history is reached, the oldest entry is removed automatically to make room for the new clipping.\r\n\r\nYou can remove an entry by selecting it and pressing _DEL_ or choose _Remove clip_ from the context menu. You remove the complete clipboard history with _Clear history_ from the _History_ menu.\r\n\r\n_Auto-start Clipdinger_ controls if Clipdinger will be started automatically at every boot-up.\r\n\r\n_Auto-paste_ will put the clipping you've chosen via double-click or _RETURN_ into the window that was active before you have summoned Clipdinger.\r\n\r\nThe other settings belong to the fading feature: When the checkbox _Fade history entries over time_ is active, entries get darker as time ticks on. You can set the intervall that entries are being tinted (_Delay_) and by how much they are tinted (_Steps_). The third slider sets the _Max. tint level_, i.e. how dark an entry can get.\r\nBelow the sliders is a summary of your setting in plain English.\r\n\r\nIf you leave your computer or just know that you won't do any copy&paste for a longer time, you can simply check the _Pause fading_ checkbox below the history list of the main window to prevent the entries in the history from fading. Note, that this checkbox is only visible if the fading option in the settings is active.\r\n\r\n### Tips & Tricks\r\n\r\n*   If you've used Clipdinger before v0.5.5, you can now remove the link to it in the `/boot/home/config/settings/boot/launch/` folder and use the new setting to auto-start instead.\r\n*   Changes in the settings window can be viewed live in the main window. To find the right fading settings for you, it's best to keep working normally for some time to fill the history and then just play around with the sliders until you're satisfied.\r\n*   Clipdinger's _Auto-paste_ feature can be a bit tricky: It doesn't know in which window you pressed _SHIFT_ + _ALT_ + _V_ for it to pop up. With activated auto-paste, it simply pastes into last window that was active before you hit _ENTER_ or double-clicked an entry. So, avoid detours...\r\n*   If you want to back-up Clipdinger's settings, history or favorites, or have the need to delete one or all of these files, you'll find them under `/boot/home/config/settings/Clipdinger/`.\r\n*\tIf the replicant of the Clipboard monitor unexpectedly gives you grief (or any replicant for that matter), you can remove all replicants on the Desktop by deleting `/boot/home/config/settings/Tracker/tracker_shelf`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nClipdinger is directly available through HaikuDepot from the HaikuPorts repository.

Also, email me if you'd like to provide more localizations.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nI have to thank Werner Freytag who created ClipUp for BeOS which was my inspiration and motivation to work on Clipdinger, to have a similar tool that works as I expect it to under Haiku.\r\nEven more thanks go to Rene Gollent, who pointed out many shortcomings in my amateurish code and provided solutions and patches.\r\nAlso, thanks to everyone that contributed translations for Clipdinger.\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\n**0.5.5** - _28-11-2016:_\r\n\r\n*   Added auto-start setting.\r\n*   Added replicatable clipboard monitor.\r\n*\tTweaked fading algorithm to fade much slower now.\r\n*\tAdded tool tip with the time and date a clip was added to the history.\r\n*\tAdded localization for British English.\r\n*\tUse standard conforming app signature \"application/x-vnd.humdinger-clipdinger\".\r\n*\tBug fix: Deleting clips with the _DEL_ key was broken.\r\n*\tBug fix: When Clipdinger is launched, add existing clipboard contents to the history.\r\n*\tBug fix: Explanatory text in settings window didn't show 4-digit minutes value and didn't show the correct values when first opened.\r\n*\tBug fix: The time a clip was added was put in too small a variable (32bit), now it's 64bit. Old history clips may experience color problems. Use _Clear history_ in that case.\r\n\r\n**0.5.4** - _12-06-2016:_\r\n\r\n*   Build fix for gcc5.\r\n*\tFixed typo in Russian localization, thanks to Diver.\r\n\r\n**0.5.3** - _11-06-2016:_\r\n\r\n*   Bug fix: Make the context menu more robust.\r\n*\tAdded Russian localization, thanks to Akujiism.\r\n\r\n**0.5.2** - _20-01-2016:_\r\n\r\n*   Bug fix: The Auto-paste setting was ignored on startup.\r\n\r\n**0.5.1** - _07-01-2016:_\r\n\r\n*   Made pasting to [Sprunge.us](http://sprunge.us) more robust.
